# Global Air Pollution Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes historical air quality data from 2010 to 2017 for 240 countries, focusing on PM2.5 (fine particulate matter). The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides mean annual exposure levels of PM2.5 in micrograms per cubic meter. The goal of this analysis is to identify and visualize trends and patterns in global air pollution, highlighting variations in pollution levels across different countries and over time.

## Data Source

## Data Visualization
After performing data cleaning and analysis using SQL, the results were imported into Tableau for interactive visualization. The following visualizations were created to provide insights into global PM2.5 levels:

**Interactive Map:**

A map color-coded based on the average PM2.5 levels across different countries. This visualization allows for geographic comparison of air pollution levels.

**Line Graph:**

A line graph displaying the mean annual exposure PM2.5 levels for all countries from 2010 to 2017. This graph enables the comparison of trends over time across different countries.

**Bar Chart:**

A bar chart showing the average PM2.5 levels between 2010-2017 for each country. This chart provides a summary view of the average pollution levels for each country across the years studied.

These visualizations help in understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of air pollution, and facilitate the comparison of PM2.5 levels across countries and over time.

## Results
The data analysis and visualization reveal several key insights into global PM2.5 pollution levels from 2010 to 2017:

**Geographic Distribution:** The interactive map provides a color-coded view of PM2.5 levels across different countries. This map highlights regions with the highest and lowest pollution levels, allowing for easy identification of areas with significant air quality concerns.

**Temporal Trends:** The line graph showcases the mean annual PM2.5 levels for all countries over the years 2010 to 2017. This visualization allows for the comparison of pollution trends across countries, revealing patterns of increase or decrease in air pollution over time.

**Annual Averages:** The bar chart illustrates the average PM2.5 levels per year for each country. This chart provides a clear summary of how air pollution levels average out annually across different countries, helping to identify countries with consistently high or low average pollution levels.

Overall, these visualizations facilitate a comprehensive understanding of global air quality trends, highlighting critical areas for potential intervention and comparison of the pollution levels of different countries.
